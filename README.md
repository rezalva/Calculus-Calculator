# Calculus-Calculator
Calculates calculus stuff

What can it do?
It only calculates positive integer numbers. In addition the equation must be error free

Goals:
- calculates floats Ex. 12.6 + 3.8
- calculates negative numbers Ex. 4 * (-5)
- calculates this thing --> 4(*5)     unorthodox, but correct
- add evaluate function so the program prints "wrong equation" and returns to input instead of Crashing.
- add algebra function
    - can graph
    - can plot
    - can create table
    - and so on...
- add calculus function
    - derivative
    - integral
    - series
    - other stuff
- add data calculator
    - not really sure what I'm going with this
    - something that calculates and graph from a file full of data
    - yeah, something like that
- add GUI with Tkinter
- make it a standalone app. Does not need an interpreter
- add binary math
 

- add other cool stuff
